/// <summary>
/// DupWithoutRename is a utility class for Unity 5 that mimics the Unity 4 behavior of Ctrl+D (or Cmd+D on Mac): objects are duplicated 
/// without being renamed. In Unity 5 they are renamed automatically, and it sucks. Place this file in Assets/Editor so that it is 
/// detected as an editor script.
/// 
/// Note that unlike the real Ctrl+D command, this one only duplicates objects in the scene hierarchy.
/// It can't duplicate other stuff, like assets in your Project database, or array entries in the editor's stock array manager GUI. 
/// For this reason, it's mapped to Ctrl+Shift+D, so you still have access to Ctrl+D for those other tasks.

// Known issue!!! While this function will duplicate selected prefabs correctly, if you duplicate a NON-prefab game object that has child objects
// that ARE prefabs, the duplicated children won't be correctly marked as prefabs. This scenario doesn't seem to occur in practice for me,
// which is good because I don't have time to try to fix it at the moment. If somebody fixes it, though, please email me! eric@heimburg.com
